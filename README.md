# MiniPlay Chrome Extension
This is the Chrome extension component of MiniPlay, which lets you control Google Play Music without hunting around for the right browser tab.  

## Getting Started
At the moment this is very much just-for-developers.  I'll get this cleaned up and put onto the Chrome extensions store at some point.  Until then:
* Clone this project
* Load the extension in Chrome, following [these Google directions(https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted)  

You'll also need the [the desktop widget](https://github.com/gropple/MiniPlayDesktop).
